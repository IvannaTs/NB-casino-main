                            website, or you can make a request through the technical

                            To ensure that all visitors can enjoy a relaxing and
                            exciting holiday, the casino has organized a comprehensive
                            protection and security system. Therefore, there is always a
                            security service at the entrance, and other specialists monitor
                            the behavior of visitors inside the casino.

                            In order to become a full member of the club, you will need to register,
                            present documents, and confirm your age. An additional protective measure is the dress code. This makes it possible to exclude the
                            appearance in the hall of people who are dressed inappropriately,
                            or behave aggressively, and definitely,
                            and interfere with other guests of a cultural holiday.

                            The casino has a serious video surveillance system. This is necessary in order
                            to ensure the integrity of the gaming process and eliminate attempts
                            at fraud on the part of clients and the dealers themselves.
                            The Canadian casino strictly adheres to the policy of responsible, safe, and fair gaming.

                        The Canadian casino works with the best 
                        software providers. Therefore, all slot machines have 
                        an RTP of at least 90%. Most of them have 95% or more. 
                        This speaks of honesty and transparency for all players who want 
                        to place bets and expect to win.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each machine undergoes thorough testing 
                            and certification. Therefore, 
                            interference in the results by the casino is impossible. Your chances and probability of winning depend
                            only on the random number generator.
